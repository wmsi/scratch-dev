Welcome to scratch-dev @ WMSI! This is where we develop Scratch 3.0 extensions in a fork of the sceratch-gui repository from LLK (github.com/LLK/scratch-gui).

Early work will be focused on replicating our scratchx extension for handling data transactions with wmsinh.org. To check out the ScratchX extensions and some example sketches, go to deprecated/scratchx-examples. 

Instructions for hosting a Scratch 3.0 GUI on your local machine can be found at https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/277217.

For a very basic example extension check out the helloWorld extension. This class is defined in scratch-gui/node-modules/scratch-vm/src/extensions/scratch3_helloWorld/index.js. You can also check out annotated_index.js in scratch-gui/.../extensions/scratch3_helloWorld/deprecated/

Our db-blocks extensions for Scratch 3 is currently under development and not part of our Scratch GUI fork. This index.js file can be found in scratch-gui/.../extensions/scratch3_db-blocks/
