<h2>Scratch-Microbit Support</h2>

The .zip file contains the original build files used to complile the microbit-scratch.hex
file used with the Scratch 3 extension. The "scratch-microbit-firmware-master" folder contains our WMSI build of the same .hex file, which adds support for the built-in temperature sensor.
